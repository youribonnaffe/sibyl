## An Android music player. ##

This project has been started within the context of a school project. We are four students from a French enginering school of Lyon called INSA. Our aim is to create an application for the Android platform, the Google operating system for mobile phones.

The application is a music player, almost like Amarok, Winamp, iTunes or whatever audio player you can find. It has basics functionnalities such as play modes / smart playlists / library management. There is also a cover manager which can download missing covers. Sibyl uses Android SDK possibilities such as animations and touch mode.

Further developments will maybe consider the interaction with social networks (last.fm for example).

Do not hesitate to mail us to suggest features or to report bugs.
You can find us on #sibyl-dev on Freenode.
