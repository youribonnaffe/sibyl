 ABOUT 

This project is currently under development so that version might be unstable and some (a lot) features are missing.
Only mp3 files are managed.

This project has been started within the context of a school project. We are four students from a French engineering school of Lyon called INSA. Our aim is to create an application for the Android platform, the Google operating system for mobile phones.

The application will be a music player, like Amarok, Winamp, iTunes or whatever audio player you can find. At first, we will try to get a user-friendly mobile app which can play audio files (the ones supported by Android), which can also manage a music library and playlists. Then, we will probably add a cover flow functionality. Then, maybe the interaction with social networks (last.fm for example) will be considered, as well as supporting .ogg format.
